******* STANDARD INSTRUCTIONS ********
Attached you'll find a zip folder containing two files:
	1. Chartbeat<head>code.txt
	2. Chartbeat<body>code.txt

The <head> tag should be placed before the </head> tag. This code:
	1. Gets the date and time, and calculates page-load time
	2. Sets up the Chartbeat configuration object (_sf_async_config) before we load our JavaScript

The <body> tag should be placed before the closing </body> tag. This code: 
	1. Gets the Chartbeat configuration object set in the <head>
	2. Sets the section value (_sf_async_config.sections = '';)
	3. Sets the author value (_sf_async_config.author = '';)
	4. Passes the newly updated configuration object to the Chartbeat Publishing JavaScript

Section and author values must be populated. 
	1. They are highlighted in the Chartbeat <body> code file under the 'configuration start' comment. We highly recommend you populate dynamically -- the Chartbeat configuration variable can accept a global JavaScript object.
	2. If you use a Data Layer or custom tagging, change these variables to reflect your logic
	3. Here is the link to the general instructions for adding these variables: support.chartbeat.com/docs/#sectionsauthors

The dashboard is now activated, so once you put the code up, data will populate here: https://chartbeat.com/publishing/home/ .
